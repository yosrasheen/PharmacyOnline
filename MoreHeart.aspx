                                <h2>Heart attack rates drop in the area</h2>
                                <h4>Bay Area Hospitals Do Well In Heart Attack Victims' Survey </h4>
                                <p>Heart attack victims have a dramatically better chance of recovery in some Bay Area hospitals than others in the region and the state, according to a study released yesterday by state authorities.

The California Hospital Outcomes Project survey, issued by the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, examined the mortality rates of heart attack patients in more than 400 hospitals between 1991 and 1993.

Most of the hospitals surveyed did not vary from the study's projections.
But 35 California hospitals had fewer heart attack deaths than expected, and 31 facilities had worse- than-expected scores, the study said.

Of the 35 with better-than-average recovery rates, 11 are in San Francisco, Alameda, Contra Costa and San Mateo counties.

Three of the hospitals with lower-than-average rates are situated in Alameda, Contra Costa, and Santa Clara counties.
Here are the results for four San Francisco hospitals:

-- California Pacific Medical Center's California campus at 3700 California Street expected more than 22 people to die of heart attacks during the period of the study, but only 10 deaths were recorded. At the center's Pacific campus at 2333 Buchanan Street, there were 38 deaths against a projection of 53.6 expected deaths.

-- Kaiser Foundation San Francisco recorded 68 deaths against a projection of 92.1 expected deaths.

-- University of California at San Francisco Medical Center recorded 21 deaths against a projection of 21.3 expected deaths.

In examples of lower-than- average survival results, the study found that Columbia San Leandro Hospital recorded 87 deaths against a projection of 69.5 and Doctors Medical Center in Pinole recorded 46 deaths versus a projection of 36.8. Figures for the hospital in Santa Clara were not immediately available.

Dr. David Werdegar, director of the state Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development, said that "hospitals and their medical and nursing staff can use this information in their ongoing efforts to improve the quality of care."

Approximately 40,000 people are admitted to California hospitals each year with heart attacks and about 5,000 die in the hospitals.

Because heart attacks are a leading cause of death, the state survey project began by tracking mortality from heart conditions.

Using two different evaluation models, the study found that 334 hospitals had as many heart attack deaths as expected and that 18 had no deaths or too few to be statistically significant.

But the study found that the overall death rate from heart attacks dropped from 15.1 percent in 1991 to 13.9 percent in 1993.

Eppler attributed that drop to better hospital care and "greater (public) awareness of some of the things that cause heart attacks."

The survey was developed by a team representing the state and researchers from UC Davis and UC San Francisco.

"A combination of clinical expertise and statistical tests were used to identify the risk factors that were used in the adjustment process," the report said.

The statistical results in the study were adjusted to reflect the fact that some hospitals "have sicker patients than others," the report said.</p>
