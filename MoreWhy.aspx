                                <h4>Why Online Pharmacy Stores Sell Drugs at Such Cheap Prices?</h4>
                                <p>Online pharmacies are able to sell drugs at cheaper rates because an online pharmacy has a different cost structure than a normal “brick and mortar” pharmacy. It is not expensive to set up an online pharmacy; all you need is a PC and an internet connection and viola you’re hooked to the World Wide Web.

                                   Most online pharmacies do not spend much money on setting up an office; in fact a lot of online pharmacies are home based businesses. They sell, pack and distribute the drugs from their backyard or garage.

                                   Most online pharmacies also have massive buying power. This is because as they do not need much money to set up, they can concentrate on buying drugs in bulk from the manufacturers at lower prices. So coupled with its low cost structure and ability to buy huge amounts of drugs, online pharmacies can offer huge savings.

                                    Online competition also drives cheaper drug prices. When searching for drugs online, most people are looking for the best bargain. And since there is so much competition with so many pharmacies online, many online drug stores slash their prices to stay in business. This further drives other stores to keep the prices of their drugs low as well. Thus online pharmacies are able to sell drugs at cheaper rates.

                                   However, people should be aware of the fact that some online pharmacies who sell cheap drugs are often fake, and sell bogus and counterfeit medication. People should keep in mind that just because an online pharmacy is cheap, it is legitimate. Price cannot always be the leading consideration. People must remember to put safety ahead of price.

                                 <h4>Tips for Buying Prescription Drugs Online</h4>
                                 <p>The following steps can protect you while purchasing medication online;</p>
                                 
                                 <ul>
                      <li> * Consult a qualified health care professional 
                        or doctor in person before taking a new prescription 
                        medication.</li>
                      <li>* Be careful to only purchase drugs from 
                        licensed, ethical pharmacies. Or pharmacies 
                        affiliated with the National Association of 
                        Boards of Pharmacy.</li>
                      <li>* If you order drugs online, check for a 
                        valid U.S street address and phone number.</li>
                      <li>* If you receive drugs through the mail, 
                        check the expiration date printed on the bottle. 
                        If there is no date do not use the medication.</li>
                      <li>* Know what your pills look like. If the 
                        pills you receive look different from your 
                        usual prescription, do not take them.</li>
                      <li>* Don't buy from sites that offer to prescribe 
                        a prescription drug the first time without 
                        a physical exam, or sell a prescription drug 
                        without a prescription.</li>
                    </ul>
